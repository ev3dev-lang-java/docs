## Local development

To test in local, in the terminal view of Intellij execute:

[source]
----
./gradlew -t asciidoctor
----

Later, create another terminal tab and execute:

[source]
----
./gradlew livereload
----

Finally, create another terminal to serve the contents:

[source]
----
./gradlew serve
----

If you open the document in a Web browser with the live reload plugin, you could see the changes.
