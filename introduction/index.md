# Introduction

# What is EV3Dev-lang-java?

In Lego Mindstorms ecosystem, the default solution to develop Java software for Lego Mindstorms is [LeJOS](http://www.lejos.org/).
But now exists one alternative, `EV3Dev-lang-java` a Java project running on the top of [EV3Dev](http://www.ev3dev.org/).  

Lego Mindstorms ecosystem is `a nice educational way to learn Java programming in general and Robotics in particular`. 
Now, it is possible to install a complete Linux distro in the third generation of the product and others companies like 
[Mindsensors](http://www.mindsensors.com/) & [Dexter Industries](https://www.dexterindustries.com/) has released products
 which interact with Sensors & Actuators from Lego ecosystem and that boards can use the Power of the popular board 
 [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
 
But, with the help of `EV3Dev`, it is possible to have the same Linux experience for multiple boards. 
So... why not develop a Java library for that Linux Distro? The answer is `EV3Dev-lang-java`. 
The project, takes the good things of both worlds: EV3Dev with the complete linux experience 
and LeJOS with the rich local navigation stack.

**What libraries contains EV3Dev-lang-java?**
  
The project contains the following Java libraries/scripts:
  
- [EV3Dev-lang-java](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java): Low level interation with EV3Dev
- [lejos-commons](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/lejos-commons): LeJOS interfaces & utilities
- [lejos-navigation](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/lejos-navigation): LeJOS navigation stack
- [RPLidar4J](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/RPLidar4J): RPLidar A1 support
- [Battery Monitor](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/batteryMonitor): A battery monitor to protect your hardware against low battery levels
- [Installer](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer): A set of Bash scripts to automate some operations with your brick

**Advantages of the usage of this project?**

Basically, with this library you can develop educational robots with Java for multiple bricks:

- EV3 Brick
- BrickPi+
- BrickPi 3 (Scheduled on v0.7.0)
- PiStorms

Using the same objects, it is possible to deploy the software for robots on EV3 Brick, Raspberry Pi 3 with BrickPi & PiStorms.

If you analyze the hardware, any EV3 Brick uses a `SoC: Sitara Processor AM1808` (from year 2010) to manage Sensors & Actuators 
but now with the usage of a BrickPi/PiStorms unit, it is possible to use the power of a Raspberry Pi 3 increasing the 
possibilities to develop complex projects which require por Computational consumption.

**2010 Chip included on EV3 Brick:**

``` 
SoC: Sitara Processor AM1808
CPU: ARM9 300MHz
RAM: 16KB of Instruction Cache, 16KB of Data Cache ,8KB of RAM (Vector Table), 64KB of ROM
```

**2016 Chip included on Raspberry Pi 3:**

``` 
SoC: Broadcom BCM2837
CPU: 4Ã— ARM Cortex-A53, 1.2GHz
RAM: 1GB LPDDR2 (900 MHz)
```
