# Sensors

## Introduction

A human being receives signals continuously from his 5 senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch)
and that stream of data are processed or discarded by the Brain.

With a Robot occurs the same, when you plug a sensor in the brick, your program is able to process
a new kind of data from the environment.
If you classify the nature of the information which sensors measure, exist the following categories:

* **Exteroceptors Sensors** measure the environment from the robot point of view.
* **Proprioceptors Sensors** measure the internal state of robot (For example the battery level).

### Exteroceptors sensors

The following sensors are designed to measure the environment.

### Proprioceptors sensors

The following sensors are designed to measure the internal state of the robot.

## Source of sensors

The Bricks has several ways to interact with sensors from many different sources.

### Mindsensors Sensors

Mindsensors is a classic sensor manufacturer and it is possible use with the Robot the following sensors:

* AbsoluteIMU
* Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3

TIP: In the future, the list will grow.

### USB Webcams

USB Cameras is another way to measure the world.
Using OpenCV, it is possible to manage a webcam with Java.

### Grove Sensors

Grove System, offer a rich set of sensors to measure the environment.

The sensors are possible to connect with your brick in the following ways:

* EV3: Using the Mindsensors Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3
* BrickPi+: Using the Mindsensors Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3
* PiStorms V2: Using the Mindsensors Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3
* BrickPi 3: It is possible to connect a sensor directly.
