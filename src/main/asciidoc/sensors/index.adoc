# Sensors

## Introduction

A human being has 5 senses to measure signals from the environment to interact with the world.
The senses are: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch.

In same way, in a Robot, it is possible to use sensors in your robots to get data from environment or
 the internal state of itself. If you classify the nature of the information which sensors measure, you have 2 groups:

* **Exteroceptors Sensors** measure the environment from the robot point of view.
* **Proprioceptors Sensors** measure the internal state of robot (For example the battery level).
