What is EV3Dev-lang-java?
-------------------------

In Lego Mindstorms ecosystem, the default solution to develop Java
software for Lego Mindstorms is http://www.lejos.org/[LeJOS]. But now
exists one alternative, `EV3Dev-lang-java` a Java project running on the
top of http://www.ev3dev.org/[EV3Dev].

Lego Mindstorms ecosystem is
`a nice educational way to learn Java programming in general and Robotics in particular`.
Now, it is possible to install a complete Linux distro in the third
generation of the product and others companies like
http://www.mindsensors.com/[Mindsensors] &
https://www.dexterindustries.com/[Dexter Industries] has released
products which interact with Sensors & Actuators from Lego ecosystem and
that boards can use the Power of the popular board
https://www.raspberrypi.org/[Raspberry Pi 3]

But, with the help of `EV3Dev`, it is possible to have the same Linux
experience for multiple boards. So… why not develop a Java library for
that Linux Distro? The answer is `EV3Dev-lang-java`. The project, takes
the good things of both worlds: EV3Dev with the complete linux
experience and LeJOS with the rich local navigation stack.

*What libraries contains EV3Dev-lang-java?*

The project contains the following Java libraries/scripts:

* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java[EV3Dev-lang-java]:
Low level interation with EV3Dev
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/lejos-commons[lejos-commons]:
LeJOS interfaces & utilities
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/lejos-navigation[lejos-navigation]:
LeJOS navigation stack
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/RPLidar4J[RPLidar4J]: RPLidar A1
support
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/batteryMonitor[Battery Monitor]: A
battery monitor to protect your hardware against low battery levels
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer[Installer]: A set of
Bash scripts to automate some operations with your brick

*Advantages of the usage of this project?*

Basically, with this library you can develop educational robots with
Java for multiple bricks:

* EV3 Brick
* BrickPi+
* BrickPi 3 (Scheduled on v0.7.0)
* PiStorms

Using the same objects, it is possible to deploy the software for robots
on EV3 Brick, Raspberry Pi 3 with BrickPi & PiStorms.

If you analyze the hardware, any EV3 Brick uses a
`SoC: Sitara Processor AM1808` (from year 2010) to manage Sensors &
Actuators but now with the usage of a BrickPi/PiStorms unit, it is
possible to use the power of a Raspberry Pi 3 increasing the
possibilities to develop complex projects which require por
Computational consumption.

*2010 Chip included on EV3 Brick:*

....
SoC: Sitara Processor AM1808
CPU: ARM9 300MHz
RAM: 16KB of Instruction Cache, 16KB of Data Cache ,8KB of RAM (Vector Table), 64KB of ROM
....

*2016 Chip included on Raspberry Pi 3:*

....
