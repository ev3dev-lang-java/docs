# Create your first Project

## Introduction

Create your first project is not complicated, for that action, exist 2 alternatives:

- Create your project from a Template Project
- Create your project from Scratch

## Create your first project with a Gradle template project

The project provide a Gradle template project ready to run in your favourite Java IDE.

Visit this link:https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/template_project_gradle[Git repository] to download the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/template_project_gradle.git
```

Once you have downloaded the project in your personal computer,
open the project with your Java IDE to edit the file: `config.gradle`: to update IP of you Brick:


```
remotes {
    ev3dev {
        host = '10.0.1.3'
        user = 'robot'
        password = 'maker'
    }
}
```

The project are configured to send to the Brick the following example:

[source,java]
----
include::MyFirstRobot.java[]
----

The example was designed to move a mobile robot with 2 motors connected to Port A & Port B.

### Deploy your program

To deploy the example on your brick, open a `terminal` and type:

```
./gradlew deployAndRun
```

## Create your first project from scratch

Another alternative is the creation of a project from Scratch using Maven/Gradle.

To start a new project with this library, add the following repository and dependency.

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

``` xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.ev3dev-lang-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>ev3dev-lang-java</artifactId>
    <version>v0.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Playing with more examples

The project has a repository with several examples about the usage of the different libraries.
