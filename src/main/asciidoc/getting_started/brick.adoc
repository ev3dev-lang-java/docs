# Getting Started with your Brick

## Introduction

A Mindstorms Brick requires an environment to run a Java Virtual Machine.
The software to install is:

- Operating System
- Java Virtual Machine

## Operating System

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources
and provides common services for computer programs.

For LEGO Mindstorms ecosystem, `EV3Dev` is the best option for this purpose,
it provides a `Debian image` compatible with LEGO Mindsotorms EV3, BrickPi & Pistorms.

TIP: Debian is a Linux Operating System used in millions of computers on the world.
This project use Debian delivered by the project `EV3Dev` which provide a interface
to interact with `Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick` and other boards compatible like `BrickPi` & `PiStorms`.

Debian is a stable project and it has link:https://www.debian.org/releases/[released] multiple versions.
`EV3Dev` supports the following versions:

- Debian Jessie
- Debian Stretch

To install any Debian version, you will need to acquire a MicroSD Card to insert in the Brick.

### Stable version: Debian Jessie

EV3Dev has an excellent step by step guide to install the Debian image in the Brick.
Please, follow the link to link:http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/[install EV3Dev on your Brick]

### Development version: Debian Stretch

Debian Stretch for EV3Dev is not stable but it has new features to use.
In the document link:http://www.ev3dev.org/downloads/[EV3Dev downloads] it is possible to download the latest
stable version and some snapshots.

The snapshot used in the last version of this project is: link:https://oss.jfrog.org/list/oss-snapshot-local/org/ev3dev/brickstrap/2018-03-16/[2018-03-16].
Current Debian Stretch support is for EV3 Brick only. If you have BrickPi or PiStorms, It is better if you use the classic
Debian Jessie image at the moment.

### Test the installation

Once you have finished the process to install the EV3Dev image on your Brick, try to establish a remote `ssh` connection.
Verify that your Brick has a connection in the same network than your computer

[source]
----
ssh robot@192.168.1.104
----

And you should the following output

[source]

Debian jessie on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3!

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
----


If you connected with your brick then you have completed this process and
now you will have a Brick with a complete Linux distro to run any Programming language.

TIP: Please, maintain your brick always updated.

Execute the following commands before jump to the next step in this guide.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot now
```

Now, you have Linux in your Brick!

## Java Virtual Machine

Java programs need a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed in the Brick.
Depending of the Hardware and the Debian version, you will have different options.

### EV3 Brick

EV3 Brick has a SOC from 2010 and it is a bit Old. [ARM EABI](https://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort)

Available JVM:

- Oracle JRE 8 for Debian Jessie
- Open JDK 10 for Debian Stretch

#### Debian Jessie

##### Manual way

To install Oracle JRE 8 in the brick you need to download from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/javaseemeddedev3-1982511.html)
and later, copy the file `ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz` to your brick using the command `scp`.

Example:

```
scp "./ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz" "robot@192.168.1.85:/home/robot"
```

Once, you have the file on the brick, you can continue the Java installation with the installer or do yourself manually.

https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/master

##### Installer

```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/master/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh java
```

#### Manual way

```
sudo tar -zxvf "/home/robot/ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz" -C /opt
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/ejdk1.8.0/linux_arm_sflt/jre/bin/java 1
```

Now, you have Java on your EV3 Brick

### BrickPi 3 / BrickPi+ / PiStorms

Using the installer, it is possible to automate everything:

https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer

```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/develop/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh
```

### Test your installation

Once you have your bricks with the JVM, test the installation is easy.
With the remote connection opened type:

```
java -version
```

Now, your Brick is ready to receive your Java programs.
