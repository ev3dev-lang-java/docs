# Getting Started on your brick


#### Debian

Debian is a Linux Operating System used in millions of computers on the world.
This project use Debian delivered by the project `EV3Dev` which provide a interface
to interact with Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick and other boards compatible like `BrickPi` & `PiStorms`

#### Java JRE

Any Java program run on a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) so, it is necessary to install it.


## 1. Install EV3Dev on your brick

Follow the link to install EV3Dev on your brick:

http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/

Once you finish the installation process and the remote `ssh` connection test, 
you will have a complete Linux distro to run any Programming language.

**Note:** Please, maintain your brick updated. Execute the following commands 
before jump to the next step in this guide.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```

## Install Java on your brick

For this step exists 2 paths. One path is for EV3 Brick and another path for BrickPi/PiStorms users.

### EV3 Brick

The EV3 Brick was designed with a SOC based on [ARM EABI](https://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort) 
and the best JVM option for that hardware architecture is the Oracle JRE 8 to install in the brick but, it is not possible to install directly in the brick
 without any human interaction, so you need to download from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/javaseemeddedev3-1982511.html)
and later, copy the file `ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz` to your brick using the command `scp`.

Example:

```
scp "./ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz" "robot@192.168.1.85:/home/robot"
```

Once, you have the file on the brick, you can continue the Java installation with the installer or do yourself manually.

https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer

#### Using the installer

```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/develop/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh
```

#### Manual way

```
tar -zxvf "/home/robot/ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz" -C /opt
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/ejdk1.8.0/linux_arm_sflt/jre/bin/java 1
java -version
```

Now, you have Java on your EV3 Brick

### BrickPi 3 / BrickPi+ / PiStorms

Using the installer, it is possible to automate everything:

https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer

```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/develop/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh
```

## Create your first Project and deploy on your Brick

Once you have the required infrastructure on your Brick, it is possible to experiment with the libraries in some ways:

### Using a Gradle template project

If you like, you can experiment with the project, using the following project template:

https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/template_project_gradle

Download the project, update the file: `config.gradle`: with the IP of you Brick:

```
remotes {
    ev3dev {
        host = '10.0.1.3'
        user = 'robot'
        password = 'maker'
    }
}
```

To deploy the example on your brick, open a `terminal` and type:

```
./gradlew deployAndRun
```

Besides, exist a task to provide access to a Profiling tool if you execute:

```
./gradlew deployAndProfilingRun
```

### Create a project from scratch

Another alternative is the creation of a project from Scratch using Maven/Gradle.

To start a new project with this library, add the following repository and dependency.

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

``` xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.ev3dev-lang-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>ev3dev-lang-java</artifactId>
    <version>v0.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```
