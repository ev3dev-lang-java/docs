# Getting Started with your Brick

## Introduction

A Mindstorms Brick requires an environment to run a Java Virtual Machine.
The software to install is:

- Operating System
- Java Virtual Machine

## Operating System

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources
and provides common services for computer programs.

For LEGO Mindstorms ecosystem, `EV3Dev` is the best option for this purpose,
it provides a `Debian image` compatible with LEGO Mindsotorms EV3, BrickPi & Pistorms.

TIP: Debian is a Linux Operating System used in millions of computers on the world.
This project use Debian delivered by the project `EV3Dev` which provide a interface
to interact with `Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick` and other boards compatible like `BrickPi` & `PiStorms`.

Debian is a stable project and it has link:https://www.debian.org/releases/[released] multiple versions.
`EV3Dev` supports the following versions:

- Debian Jessie
- Debian Stretch

To install any Debian version, you will need to acquire a MicroSD Card to insert in the Brick.

### Debian Stretch (EV3)

EV3Dev has an excellent step by step guide to install the Debian image in the Brick.
Please, follow the link to link:http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/[install EV3Dev on your Brick]

#### Increase the CPU

Read the following article to increase the EV3 CPU:
https://lechnology.com/2018/06/overclocking-lego-mindstorms-ev3-part-2/

It is possible to increase the CPU from 300Mhz to 456Mhz. You will observe a great performance improvement when you
run your Java programs or when you use Apt.

### Debian Jessie (BrickPi+/BrickPi3/PiStorms)

If you have BrickPi or PiStorms, It is better if you use the classic Debian Jessie image at the moment.

### Test the installation

Once you have finished the process to install the EV3Dev image on your Brick, try to establish a remote `ssh` connection.
Verify that your Brick has a connection in the same network than your computer

[source]
----
ssh robot@192.168.1.104
----

And you should the following output

Debian jessie on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3!

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
----


If you connected with your brick then you have completed this process and
now you will have a Brick with a complete Linux distro to run any Programming language.

TIP: Please, maintain your brick always updated.

Execute the following commands before jump to the next step in this guide.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot now
```

*Now, you have Linux in your Brick!*

## Java Virtual Machine

Java programs need a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed in the Brick.
Depending of the Hardware and the Debian version, you will have different options to install it.

### EV3 Brick

For EV3, it is possible to install the following JVM:

- Open JDK 11 for Debian

Using this project, the developer has 3 alternatives to install a JVM:

- Manual
- Using the project Installer
- Using Gradle tasks from Template Project which interacts with Installer

#### Manual

You can download the last OpenJDK build for EV3 from link:https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/ev3dev/[AdoptOpenJDK CI]

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your EV3 Brick to
install OpenJDK on your brick.

```
wget -N https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/ev3dev/job/openjdk11_build_ev3_linux/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/jri-ev3.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf jri-ev3.tar.gz -C /opt
mv /opt/jri-ev3/ /opt/jri-11
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jri-11/bin/java 1011
java -Xshare:dump
```

*Now, you have Java on your EV3 Brick!*

#### Installer

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your EV3 Brick to
to execute the installer.


```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/master/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh java
```

#### Gradle Template project

The template project provides some Gradle tasks to interact with Installer project to install Java.

The available tasks:

- getInstaller
- installJava
- javaVersion

### BrickPi 3 / BrickPi+ / PiStorms

Bricks using Raspberry Pi hardware has more CPU/Memory capacity and it is possible to install from Debian Packages.

WARNING: The project only offer support for Debian Jessie at the moment.

#### Debian Jessie

##### Manual

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your Brick to
install Oracle JRE 8 on your brick.

```
apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com EEA14886
echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
java -Xshare:dump
```

##### Installer

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your Brick to
to execute the installer.

```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/master/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh java
```

##### Gradle Template project

The template project provides some Gradle tasks to interact with Installer project to install Java.

The available tasks:

- getInstaller
- installJava
- javaVersion

### Test your installation

Once you finish the JVM installation process, it is necessary to verify the installation.
Execute the following statement to check that Java command is running in the right way.

```
java -version
```

*Now, your Brick is ready to run your Java programs.*
