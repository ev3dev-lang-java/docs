# Getting Started with your Brick

## Introduction

A Mindstorms Brick requires an environment to run a Java Virtual Machine.
The software to install is:

- Operating System
- Java Virtual Machine

## Operating System

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources
and provides common services for computer programs.

For LEGO Mindstorms ecosystem, `EV3Dev` is the best option for this purpose,
it provides a `Debian image` compatible with LEGO Mindsotorms EV3, BrickPi & Pistorms.

TIP: Debian is a Linux Operating System used in millions of computers on the world.
This project use Debian delivered by the project `EV3Dev` which provide a interface
to interact with `Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick` and other boards compatible like `BrickPi` & `PiStorms`.

Debian is a stable project and it has link:https://www.debian.org/releases/[released] multiple versions.
`EV3Dev` supports the following versions:

- Debian Jessie
- Debian Stretch

To install any Debian version, you will need to acquire a MicroSD Card to insert in the Brick.

### Stable version: Debian Jessie

EV3Dev has an excellent step by step guide to install the Debian image in the Brick.
Please, follow the link to link:http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/[install EV3Dev on your Brick]

### Development version: Debian Stretch

Debian Stretch for EV3Dev is not stable but it has new features to use.
In the document link:http://www.ev3dev.org/downloads/[EV3Dev downloads] it is possible to download the latest
stable version and some snapshots.

WARNING: The snapshot used in the last version of this project is: link:https://oss.jfrog.org/list/oss-snapshot-local/org/ev3dev/brickstrap/2018-03-16/[2018-03-16].
Current Debian Stretch support is for EV3 Brick only. If you have BrickPi or PiStorms, It is better if you use the classic
Debian Jessie image at the moment.

### Test the installation

Once you have finished the process to install the EV3Dev image on your Brick, try to establish a remote `ssh` connection.
Verify that your Brick has a connection in the same network than your computer

[source]
----
ssh robot@192.168.1.104
----

And you should the following output

[source]

Debian jessie on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3!

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
----


If you connected with your brick then you have completed this process and
now you will have a Brick with a complete Linux distro to run any Programming language.

TIP: Please, maintain your brick always updated.

Execute the following commands before jump to the next step in this guide.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot now
```

*Now, you have Linux in your Brick!*

## Java Virtual Machine

Java programs need a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installed in the Brick.
Depending of the Hardware and the Debian version, you will have different options to install it.

### EV3 Brick

EV3 Brick has a SOC from 2010 and it is a bit Old.
Further information about link:https://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort[ARM EABI architecture].

Available JVM:

- Oracle JRE 8 for Debian Jessie
- Open JDK 10 for Debian Stretch

Using this project, the developer has 3 alternatives to install a JVM:

- Manual
- Using the project Installer
- Using Gradle tasks from Template Project which interacts with Installer

WARNING: Not all alternatives are enabled for all cases. Review the documentation carefully and if you
continue with doubts, link:https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java/issues[open a support issue] to clarify and improve the documentation.

#### Debian Jessie

##### Manual

On Debian Jessie + EV3 Brick the JVM available to use is Oracle JRE 8.
To install this JVM in the Brick you need to download from link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/javaseemeddedev3-1982511.html[here]
and later, copy the file `ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz` to your brick using the command `scp`.

*Example:*

```
scp "./ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz" "robot@192.168.1.85:/home/robot"
```

Once, you have the file on the Brick, execute the following statements in a Terminal to unzip and
enable the `java` command in the system:

```
sudo tar -zxvf "/home/robot/ejdk-8-fcs-b132-linux-arm-sflt-03_mar_2014.tar.gz" -C /opt
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/ejdk1.8.0/linux_arm_sflt/jre/bin/java 8
```

*Now, you have Java on your EV3 Brick!*

##### Installer

Using the project link:https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer[Installer] is possible to automate
some operations like Java installation once Oracle JRE 8 zip is on the brick on path: `/home/robot/`

```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/master/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh
```

##### Gradle Template project

WARNING: This option is not available for Debian Jessie at the moment.

#### Debian Stretch

In Debian Stretch, we are able to build `OpenJDK 10` for `EV3` so the Java installation experience is improved because
it is possible to automate the whole Java instalation process.

Now, it is possible to download OpenJDK from this link:https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/openjdk-ev3/[repository].

##### Manual way

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your EV3 Brick to
install OpenJDK on your brick.

```
wget -N https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/openjdk-ev3/releases/download/v0.5.0/jri10-ev3.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf jri10-ev3.tar.gz -C /opt
mv /opt/jri-ev3/ /opt/jri-10-build-050
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jri-10-build-050/bin/java 10
```

##### Installer

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your EV3 Brick to
to execute the installer.


```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/master/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh java
```

##### Gradle Template project

The template project provides some Gradle tasks to interact with Installer project to install Java.
The available tasks:

- getInstaller
- installJava
- javaVersion

### BrickPi 3 / BrickPi+ / PiStorms

Bricks using Raspberry Pi hardware has more CPU/Memory capacity and it is possible to install from Debian Packages.

WARNING: The project only offer support for Debian Jessie.

#### Debian Jessie

##### Manual

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your Brick to
install Oracle JRE 8 on your brick.

```
apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com EEA14886
echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

##### Installer

Using the terminal, execute the following statements on a remote connection session from your Brick to
to execute the installer.

```
cd /home/robot
mkdir installer
cd installer
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer/master/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh help
sudo ./installer.sh
```

##### Gradle Template project

WARNING: This option is not available for Debian Jessie at the moment.

### Test your installation

Once you finish the JVM installation process, it is necessary to verify the installation.
Execute the following statement to check that Java command is running in the right way.

```
java -version
```

*Now, your Brick is ready to run your Java programs.*
