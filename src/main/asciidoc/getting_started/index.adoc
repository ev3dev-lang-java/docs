# Getting Started

## Introduction

Learn or test a new Technology is always a new challenge.
This section tries to reduce the time invested to install
the componentes required on your Personal
computer and the `Mindstorms Brick` to enjoy with the `Robots` that you will be create with `Java`.

The project has been designed with the idea that the user creates Java programs in a Personal computer
and later send the programs to any Mindstorms Brick with the help of remote connections.
Following this approach, the user will learn the same techniques applied in the industry with Enterprise applications
but in this case, applying the same techniques in a educational Robotics context with Java.

## Software & Hardware requirements

### Personal computer

Modern development environments  always require the same stuff:

- A package manager
- Java JDK
- Build Systems (Maven & Gradle)
- Java IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
- Git & SourceTree

A package manager to install software easily, a runtime about the technology,
a build system to manage the dependencies and the whole software life cycle,
integrated development environments and tools to store code in source code repositories.

In the section about link:laptop.html[Getting started with your personal computer],
you will learn how to install all components for the most popular Operating systems in the market:

- Windows
- OSX
- Linux

In order to develop software for Robots with Java.

### Mindstorms Brick

The Mindstorms Brick is the heart of this project. In the third generation of the product series LEGO Mindstorms,
exist in the 3 market 3 possible Bricks compatible with this project:

- LEGO Mindstorms EV3
- BrickPi
- PiStorms

The requirements to execute Java programs in any Brick are the same that in any Personal computer:

- Operating System
- Java Virtual Machine

In the section about link:brick.html[Getting started with your Brick],
you will learn how to install the components.

## Template project

Exist a ready to use link:https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/template_project_gradle[Template project]
which help you in the process to create new project with your favourite Java IDE. Review the
document about link:create-your-first-project.html[Getting started with your first project] to learn
how to use this Template project.

.Maven Template project
[NOTE]
In the future, we will add a new Maven project with the same purpose.

## The Next Step

Continue with the next section about: link:../#fundamentals-of-robotics[Fundamentals of Robotics]

but if you stopped in some point, read previous documents again and if the problem
 continues, create a link:https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java/issues/[Support issue on the project].
