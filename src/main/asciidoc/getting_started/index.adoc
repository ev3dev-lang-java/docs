# Getting Started

## Introduction

This section will guide you in your first steps with the project.
To execute in your Brick your first robotics program with Java,
it is necessary to install some components in your personal computer and your Brick.

The project has been designed with the idea that the user creates Java programs in a Personal computer
and later send the programs to Brick using a remote connections. With this approach, the user will learn the same techniques applied in the industry with Enterprise applications
but in this case with Robotics programs with Java.

## Personal computer

To use the libraries developed in this project, it is necessary to have installed
in the personal computer a modern Java development environment composed by the following elements:

- Java JDK
- Build Systems (Maven & Gradle)
- Git & SourceTree
- Java IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse


In the section about link:laptop.html[Getting started with your personal computer],
you will learn how to install that elements.

## Brick

This project supports multiple platforms like Lego Mindstorms EV3, BrickPi & PiStorms.
If you have one of them, it is possible to use this project. In the section about link:./getting_started/brick.html[Getting started with your Brick],
you will learn how to install a Linux Operating System and Java JRE to run later your own
 robotics programs with Java.
