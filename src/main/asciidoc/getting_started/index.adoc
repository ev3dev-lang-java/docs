# Getting Started

## Introduction

Learn or test a new Technology is always a new challenge. This section tries to
reduce the time invested to install the required software to enjoy with
`Java` and `Robotics` with the help of the products from Lego Mindstorms ecosystem.
To start programming Robotics with Java, it is necessary to install some components in your personal computer and your Brick.

The project has been designed with the idea that the user creates Java programs in a Personal computer
and later send the programs to Brick using a remote connections. With this approach, the user will learn the same techniques applied in the industry with Enterprise applications
but in this case with Robotics programs with Java.

## The Steps

### Personal computer

Modern environment to development requires always the same stuff:
a package managers to install software easily, Runtine oriented to the technology, Build system to manage the dependencies and the whole life cycle,
Integrated development environments IDE & Tools to store code in source code repositories.
In this project, the components to install are:

- A package manager
- Java JDK
- Build Systems (Maven & Gradle)
- Java IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
- Git & SourceTree

In the section about link:laptop.html[Getting started with your personal computer],
you will learn how to install all components.

### Brick

The process to install software in the Brick is easier, we only have 2 steps:

- Install a Operating System
- Install a Java Virtual Machine, JVM

If your Brick is a Lego Mindstorms EV3, BrickPi or PiStorms then you could use this project.
In the section about link:brick.html[Getting started with your Brick],
you will learn how to install the components.

## The Next Step

If you are reading this section, **Congratulations**, you have just reached 2 Goals:

- You executed the classic Java program `Hello World` in your personal computer
- You executed some classic Java programs in your Brick.

In that case, continue with the next section about: `Fundamentals of Robotics`
but if you stopped in some point, read previous documents again and if the problem
 continues, create a link:https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java/issues/[Support issue on the project].
