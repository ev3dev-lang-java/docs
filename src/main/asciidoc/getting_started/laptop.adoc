# Getting Started with your personal computer

## Introduction

This project is about `Java` to create Software for `Robots`, so the first question that you need to answer is:

TIP: Is my personal computer ready to write Java programs in general?

If the answer is **Yes**, you could Skip this document and jump directly to the section
link:brick.html[Getting started with your Brick] but if you didnÂ´ install Java and other Java components related
in the computer that you are going to use with this project then it is pretty useful that continue reading this document.

## The modern Java development environment

`Java` is possible to run in the most popular desktop Operating Systems like: `OSX`, `Windows` & `Ubuntu`
and Robotics platforms like `Lego Mindstorms`. The components that you will have to install are:

- A package manager
- Java JDK
- Build Systems (Maven & Gradle)
- Java IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
- Sources & Repositories (Git & SourceTree)

The software listed previously is possible to install manually but it is better the usage of Package installer tools
like `Brew` for OSX or `apt` for Ubuntu.

### OSX

If your personal computer is manufactured from Apple, the following instructions will help you.

#### Homebrew, the package manager for OSX

Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system.

To check if you installed Homebrew:

[source]
----
brew config
----

You should view the following output:

In the next sections we will continue using HomeBrew for the rest of installation.

TIP: If you have some problem with some concrete installation, you could install manually but it is bettert to unify
the way to install everything.

#### Java

To program, with Java, it is necessary to install in your laptop a
A Java Development Kit (JDK).

A Java Development Kit (JDK) is a program development environment
for writing Java applications. It consists of a runtime environment that "sits on top" of the operating system layer
as well as the tools and programming that developers need to compile, debug, and run applications
written in the Java language.

To begin using Java:

[source]
----
brew update
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install Caskroom/cask/java
----

Test your java installation is easy:

[source]
----
java -version
----

You should view the following output:

[source]
----
java version "1.8.0_121"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)
----

To check if you can compile java files, create a file with the name of HelloWorld.java and copy and paste on it the following content:

[source,java]
----
include::./HelloWorld.java[]
----

Later, open a terminal and type:

``` java
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

You should read: `HelloWorld` in the terminal.

#### Build Systems (Maven/Gradle)

Modern Java development use dependencies stored on Software Repositories.
It is a good idea if you install the popular Build Systems as `Maven` & `Gradle`


[source]
----
brew install maven
brew install gradle
----

Further information about Maven &amp; Gradle:
https://maven.apache.org/[https://maven.apache.org/]
https://gradle.org/[https://gradle.org/]

#### Java IDE


To develop any Java file, with a text editor is enough but the right way to develop Java programs is using a Modern IDE
like `IntelliJ` or `Eclipse`

[source]
----
brew cask install intellij-idea
brew cask install eclipse-java
----

Install a Java IDE to develop Java Software
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/]

#### Sources & Repositories (Git & SourceTree)

Git is a popular technology to manage code. Many ideas that you see on Internet are stored on
Git repositories so manage this technology is necessary.
Besides, the project includes some project templates to help you in the process to have your first project
ready to use with your brick.
