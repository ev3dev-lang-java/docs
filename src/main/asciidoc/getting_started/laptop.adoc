# Getting Started with your personal computer

## Introduction

This project is about the creation of `Java` programs for `Robots`, so the first question that you need to answer is:

TIP: Is my personal computer ready to write Java programs in general?

If the answer is **Yes**, you could jump directly to the section
link:brick.html[Getting started with your Brick] but
if you didnÂ´t install Java and other components related with this Java development
then continue reading this document.

## The modern Java development environment

`Java` is possible to run in the most popular desktop Operating Systems like: `Windows`, `OSX` & `Ubuntu`.

The components that you will have to install are:

- A package manager
- Java JDK
- Build Systems (Maven & Gradle)
- Java IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
- Sources & Repositories (Git & SourceTree)

The software listed previously is possible to install manually but
it is better the usage of a `package installer`
like `HomeBrew` for OSX or `apt` for Linux.

Click in the Operating System installed in your personal computer to check the requirements.

- link:laptop_osx.html[OSX]
- Linux

## Next step

Once you have a Java environment available to develop software,
we will review the requirements for your Mindstorms Brick.
