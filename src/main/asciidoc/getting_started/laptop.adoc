# Getting Started with your personal computer

## Introduction

In this section, you will learn how to install a Modern Java development environment.
If previously you have developed with Java, maybe you could skip this section and put the focus
on the link:brick.html[Brick] requirements.

## The modern Java development environment

`Java` is a General purpose programming language and is possible to run
in the most popular desktop Operating Systems like: `Windows`, `OSX` & `Ubuntu`.

A modern Java development environment require the following elements to be installed in your computer:

- A package manager
- Java JDK
- Build Systems (Maven & Gradle)
- Java IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
- Sources & Repositories (Git & SourceTree)

The software listed previously is possible to install manually but
it is better the usage of a `package installer`
like `HomeBrew` `SDK` for OSX/Linux, `apt` for Linux or `Choco` for Windows.

TIP: A package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of
installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system
in a consistent manner.
