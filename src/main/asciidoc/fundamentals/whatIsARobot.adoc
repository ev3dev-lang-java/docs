*Machine:*

A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to
perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical,
thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized.

*Autonomy:*

Autonomy or Autonomous behavior is a contentious term in reference to
unmanned vehicles due to the poor understanding of whether something
acting without outside commands is doing so through its own ability to
make decisions or through a method of decision making pre-programmed
into it.

*Energy:*

In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object
in order to perform work on – or to heat – the object, and can be
converted in form, but not created or destroyed.[

*Technology:*

Technology (``science of craft'', from Greek τέχνη, techne, ``art,
skill, cunning of hand''; and -λογία, -logia[2]) is the collection of
techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of
goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as
scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques,
processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be
operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.
