# Sensors

## Introduction

A human being receives signals continuously from his 5 senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch)
and that stream of data are processed or discarded by the Brain.

With a Robot occurs the same, when you plug a sensor into the brick and
you execute a program which use a sensor the process about data reading from
the environment is quite similar. Sensors are classifid by the nature of the information measured and exist two categories:

* **Exteroceptors Sensors** measure the environment from the robot point of view.
* **Proprioceptors Sensors** measure the internal state of robot (For example the battery level).

### Exteroceptors sensors

The following sensors are designed to measure the environment.

* link:ev3-ir-sensor/index.html[EV3 Infrared sensor]
* link:ev3-touch-sensor/index.html[EV3 Touch sensor]
* link:ev3-light-sensor/index.html[EV3 Light sensor]

### Proprioceptors sensors

The following sensors are designed to measure the internal state of the robot.

## Source of sensors

Lego mindstorms ecosystem offer several several sensors to use with your Bricks.
In the following lists, we will show some examples about sensors available to use with
this project.

### Mindsensors Sensors

Mindsensors is a classic sensor manufacturer and it is possible use with the Robot the following sensors:

* AbsoluteIMU
* Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3

TIP: In the future, the list will grow.

### USB Cameras

USB Cameras is another way to measure the world.
Using OpenCV, it is possible to manage a webcam with Java.

### Grove Sensors

Grove System, offer a rich set of sensors to measure the environment.
Grove is a modular, standardized connector prototyping system.
Grove takes a building block approach to assembling electronics.
Compared to the jumper or solder based system, it is easier to connect,
experiment and build and simplifies the learning system,
but not to the point where it becomes dumbed down.

The sensors are possible to connect with your brick in the following ways:

* EV3: Using the Mindsensors Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3
* BrickPi+: Using the Mindsensors Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3
* PiStorms V2: Using the Mindsensors Grove Sensor Adapter for EV3
* BrickPi 3: It is possible to connect a sensor directly.
