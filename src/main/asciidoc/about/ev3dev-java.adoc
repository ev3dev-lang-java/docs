# What is EV3Dev-java?

A Java project to build Software for Robots using hardware supported by EV3Dev & the LeJOS way.

## Introduction

Lego Mindstorms ecosystem is
`a fantastic educational way to learn Java, Linux and Robotics` to develop your creativity using your favourite Bricks.
In the the third generation of the product link:https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms[Lego Mindstorms EV3],
others companies like link:https://www.dexterindustries.com/[Dexter Industries]
& link:http://www.mindsensors.com/[Mindsensors] has released boards combining the power of
link:https://www.raspberrypi.org/[Raspberry Pi 3] with the usage of Sensors & Actuators from Lego Mindstorms ecosystem.
The result is very healthy for the Community but... some questions appear in the air:

- How to manage the hardware in an easy way?
- How to continue using Java with all boards?
- What happen with amazing LeJOS libraries about `local-navigation` in this context?

The answer is this project, **EV3Dev-java**.

## EV3Dev-java Subprojects

`EV3Dev-java` has been designed with the modularity in mind from the beginning.

The project contains the following Java libraries/scripts:

* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java[EV3Dev-lang-java]:
Low level interation library with EV3Dev
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/lejos-commons[lejos-commons]:
LeJOS interfaces & utilities
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/lejos-navigation[lejos-navigation]:
LeJOS navigation stack
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/RPLidar4J[RPLidar4J]: RPLidar A1
support
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/batteryMonitor[Battery Monitor]: A
battery monitor to protect your hardware against low battery levels
* https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/installer[Installer]: A set of
Bash scripts to automate some operations with your brick

## Competitive advantages

This project has the following competitive advantages:

* Usage of the same Java libraries for multiple bricks (EV3 Brick, BrickPi 3, BrickPi+ & PiStorms)
* Usage of USB Connections for Arduino
* Usage of complex Devices like LIDARs, Webcams or Advanced IMUs with USB.
* Usage of a Complete Linux
* Usage of `LeJOS` libraries

If you analyze the hardware, any EV3 Brick uses a
`SoC: Sitara Processor AM1808` (from year 2010) to manage Sensors &
Actuators but now with the usage of a BrickPi/PiStorms unit, it is
possible to use the power of a Raspberry Pi 3 increasing the
possibilities to develop complex projects which require por
Computational consumption.

*2010 Chip included on EV3 Brick:*

....
SoC: Sitara Processor AM1808
CPU: ARM9 300MHz
RAM: 16KB of Instruction Cache, 16KB of Data Cache ,8KB of RAM (Vector Table), 64KB of ROM
....

*2016 Chip included on Raspberry Pi 3:*

....
SoC: Broadcom BCM2837
CPU: 4Ã— ARM Cortex-A53, 1.2GHz
RAM: 1GB LPDDR2 (900 MHz)
....

## Timeline of the project

In 2015, EV3Dev is born to offer a solution to install a complete
link:https://www.debian.org[Linux Debian Operating System] on
link:https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms[EV3 Brick],
link:https://www.dexterindustries.com/brickpi/[BrickPi Series] &
link:http://www.mindsensors.com/content/78-pistorms-lego-interface[PiStorms Series].
The project provides an agnostic Linux interface to unify the way to interact with Mindstorms Hardware too.

At the end of the same year, `EV3Dev-lang-java` is born with the idea to continue developing Java robots
on Lego Mindstorms and providing a port of `LeJOS` libraries like the `local-navigation` stack.

In 2017 Q3, the project will be renamed as `EV3Dev-java` to be shorted and to not generate confusion with the usage
of link:https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang[EV3Dev binding features].

## Evolution of Java on Lego Mindstorms ecosystem

LeJOS project is the unique Open Source project present on every Lego Mindstorms generations of the product.
In any generation, the project had to find a solution for the following layers:

* Runtime
* JVM
* Robotics libraries

This premise was solved in every Mindstorms generation:

[options="header,footer"]
|=======================
|Product             | RCX               | NXT                    | EV3
|Runtime             | Custom firmware   | Custom firmware        | Busybox + Native libraries
|JVM                 | Custom JVM        | Custom JVM             | Oracle JRE 8
|Robotics libraries  | Initial libraries | local-navigation-stack | ~
|=======================

but now in 2017, any Java developer could have issues with the following scenarios:

- The usage of LeJOS objects on BrickPi3/PiStormsV2
- The USB connection with any Arduino board
- Make a map with a LIDAR like RPLidar A2
- Execute a linux command like `screen` to maintain a `ssh` session although you close the laptop
- Install ROS on your Brick
- Interact with other programming languages

So, to solve this kind of projects appear `EV3Dev-java`.
