# Sensors

# Introduction
Human being has 5 senses to measure signals from the environment to interact with the world. The senses are: sight, 
hearing, taste, smell and touch.

In robotics, it is possible to add sensors in your robots to get data from environment or internal state of that 
creation to intereact. Robots built with a EV3 has the opportunity to use 4 sensors connected to the brick. 
If you classify the nature of the information which sensors measure, you have 2 groups:

1. “exteroceptors” for the measurement of its environmental (external, from the robot point of view) parameters.
2. “proprioceptors” for the measurement of the robot’s (internal) parameters

**Exteroceptors sensors**
Exteroceptors are sensors that measure the positional or force-type interaction of the robot with its environment. 

**Proprioceptors sensors**
Proprioception in robotics means sensing the internal state of the robot or a part of it . For example the posture of 
a mechanical manipulator, leg or other jointed mechanism or the battery level.
